class BackendServer:
    """
    Represents a backend server in the reverse proxy load balancing pool.

    This class tracks the health, performance metrics, and connection state of a single
    backend server. It maintains rolling statistics for response times and request
    success rates, providing the data needed for intelligent load balancing decisions.

    Attributes:
        url (str): The base URL of the backend server (e.g., "http://localhost:8001")
        healthy (bool): Current health status of the backend server
        last_check_time (float): Timestamp of the last health check (monotonic time)
        active_connections (int): Number of currently active connections to this backend
        total_requests (int): Total number of requests forwarded to this backend
        failed_requests (int): Number of requests that failed or timed out
        response_times (deque[float]): Rolling window of response times (max 100 entries)

    Note:
        - URL is automatically normalized by removing trailing slashes
        - Response times are stored in a bounded deque to prevent memory leaks
        - Health status is updated by the HealthChecker component

        Normalizes the backend URL by removing trailing slashes to ensure
        consistent URL handling when constructing target URLs for requests.

        Example:
            "http://localhost:8001/" â†’ "http://localhost:8001"

    def avg_response_time(self) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the average response time

        This property provides a rolling average of response times, which is used
        by load balancing strategies like "fastest_avg_response" to route requests
        to the most responsive backend servers.

        The calculation uses a bounded deque of the most recent 100 response times
        to provide a current performance snapshot while preventing memory growth.

        Returns:
            float: Average response time in seconds, rounded to 4 decimal places.
                  Returns 0.0 if no response times have been recorded.

        Example:
            >>> backend = BackendServer("http://localhost:8001")
            >>> backend.add_response_time(0.1)
            >>> backend.add_response_time(0.2)
            >>> backend.avg_response_time
            0.15

        Note:
            - Older response times are automatically discarded when the deque is full
            - Useful for load balancing algorithms that prefer faster backends

        Calculate the success rate percentage for this backend server.

        The success rate is calculated as the percentage of successful requests
        out of the total requests made to this backend. Failed requests include
        timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx).

        Returns:

                  Returns 100.0 if no requests have been made (avoiding division by zero).
